# AbsoluteLoader
This is my approach of creating an Absolute loader using java language for system programming course 


We have a file called ASSEMBLER.txt that has the programs that will be loading using our loader.

when we run the java program it will ask us to write the program name 

We will write "SAMPLE" for example

then it will ask us for the program length which is 000035 and you can find these information in the ASSEMBLER.txt file

this is the output

Enter The Program Name : SAMPLE
Enter The Program Length
000035
Program Found
